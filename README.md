# StepperMotor Control
This project is focused on deploying Dr Gan's carbon fibre machine only on Arduino. It consists of 3 stepper motor controls with xy plane.

# This repository is currently in development...
1. Project file contains code for entire project, make sure all connection is correct before running
2. steppertest file contains code for testing on steppermotor using digital write.
3. stepperacceltest file contains code for testing on steppermotor using accelstepper library

# Getting Started
1. Download the zip code of this file, then extract it.
2. Follow the pdf instruction, at the end there's a schematic.
3. Upload code to Arduino after circuit is complete.

# Contribute
1. Project is fixed, will be working on fixing shield.
2. Real problem was power source insufficient as each servos need 1A, so best case is 3 servos connected with 3 different power supply

#This project was previously done by Wo Yew Ben and Wei Hong, I'm just fixing it.

#HAPPY CODING!!! :heart:
