# StepperMotor Control
This project is focused on deploying Dr Gan's carbon fibre machine only on Arduino. It consists of 3 stepper motor controls with xy plane.

# This repository is currently in development...
1. project file contains the file for the said 'bugless' code to debug. Problem is still unknown. Motors just won't move.
2. steppertest file contains code for testing on steppermotor using digital write.
3. stepperacceltest file contains code for testing on steppermotor using accelstepper library

# Getting Started
1. Download the zip code of this file, then extract it.
2. Follow the pdf instruction, at the end there's a schematic.
3. Upload code to Arduino after circuit is complete.

# Contribute
1. project file is not working for some reason, could be driver problem.

#This project was previously done by Wo Yew Ben and Liew Wei Hong, I'm just fixing it.

#HAPPY CODING!!! :heart:
